Today's technologies are helping people collect and produce data at phenomenal rates. Despite the abundance of data, it remains largely inaccessible due to the skill required to explore, query and analyze it in a non-trivial fashion. While many users know exactly what they are looking for, they have trouble expressing sophisticated queries in interfaces that require knowledge of a programming language or a query language. Azza designs novel interfaces, such as example-driven query tools, that simplify data querying and analysis. Her research work combines techniques from various research fields such as UI-design, machine learning, and databases. Azza Abouzied received her doctoral degree from Yale in 2013.

Khulood Alawadi,Engineering,Lecturer of Engineering Design,"MSc Imperial College London, MA Royal College of Art",khulood.alawadi@nyu.edu,Human-centered design; ethnographic design research; women in design; forecasting for design futures.,"Khulood Alawadi is no stranger to the New York University Abu Dhabi community. Prior to her installation as a Lecturer in Engineering Design, she contributed to NYU Abu Dhabi with her research in science visualisation, design, and advanced manufacturing. With an MA in Innovation Design Engineering from the Royal College of Art, London, and an MSc with distinction in the same, from Imperial College, London, Khulood Alawadi approaches engineering through the lens of a designer and artist. From her facilitation of human-centred design workshops in Dubai, to her curation of exhibitions exploring the influence of design on health services in Nairobi- she is unfettered by the confines of one single area of design. Khulood Alawadi embraces the idea that design engineering should be viewed as a bricolage, of which, like herself, her students should feel the freedom and curiosity to explore first, and then define second. Allowing them to push the envelope on design theory and the investigation into the ways that it influences our lives. A challenger to the status quo of design engineering, Khulood Alawadi believes in questioning the ìHow?î. How has technology influenced the fields of art and design? How has male-dominance in the industry, centered and molded the perspective of those incoming and the work that they develop? How can her mere existence in showing up in this space as an Arab and a woman, change the narrative and expectation for those to come?",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/khulood-alawadi/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg

These changes are important vectors of political instability and civil unrest.

Kanchan Chandra,Social Science,Professor of Political Science,PhD Harvard,kc76@nyu.edu,Ethnicity; Democracy; Violence; Patronage; Party politics,"Kanchan Chandra (PhD 2000, Harvard), Professor of Politics at NYU, works on questions of ethnicity, democracy, violence, patronage and clientelism, party politics and the politics of South Asia. She is lead author of Democratic Dynasties (Cambridge University Press, 2016) Constructivist Theories of Ethnic Politics (Oxford University Press, 2012) (introduction) , author of Why Ethnic Parties Succeed: Patronage and Ethnic Headcounts in India (Cambridge University Press, 2004) (introduction) and of articles in several leading journals.Her work has been supported by fellowships from the Princeton Program on Democracy and Development, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation, the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioural Sciences, the Russell Sage Foundation and research grants from the National Science Foundation, and the United States Institute of Peace.Her previous work explores what the constructed nature of ethnic identity means for theories and data on the causes and consequences of ethnic mobilization. It proposes a new conceptual framework for thinking about ethnic identity and uses this framework to theories about the relationship between ethnicity, politics, and economics. Taking the possibility of ethnic identity change into account, she argues, dismantles theoretical logics linking ethnic diversity to negative outcomes and processes such as democratic destabilization, clientelism, riots, and state collapse. Even more importantly it changes the questions we can ask about the relationship between ethnicity, politics, and economics.She is currently working on two large-scale research projects (1) A project which theorizes about the effect of ethnic mobilization on democratic stability and governance from a constructivist perspective, combining field research with cross-national data on ethnic parties and violence around the world. (2) A project on democratic transformations in South Asia. This employs in-depth studies within a single country and comparison across clusters or countries to explain new aspects of politics in South Asian democracies such as the emergence of dynastic politics, changes in the structure of the post-liberalization state, business-state relations, and left-ideological movements.Both projects combine fine-grained field research and cross-national data with a broad theoretical and comparative perspective. They also experiment with new ways of crediting the collaborative aspect of the relationship between social scientists and their so called ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù in field research, and with other forms of collaboration between social scientists that complement and deepen solo-authored work. These experiments explore questions first raised by the American Political Science Association‚Äôs working group on collaboration, which she chaired in 2006.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/kanchan-chandra/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg

Her sculptures pick up on historic sculptural and architectonic paradigms, which she modifies and places in constellations such that the presence of the works is interwoven with glimpses of past cultural formations. Addressing the beholder's bodily reality, her art sustains a situated experience, while also charting fields of associations that have bearing on his or her position, actual as much as imagined, in the world. Peters pursues these concerns both in sculpture strictly conceived and in a range of other media, exploring a variety of formats (sound installation, moving image, film, performance).In 2009‚Äì2012, Peters undertook extensive studies into the oeuvre of Rudolph Schindler, an endeavor that bore fruit in a number of works that take inspiration from the architect‚Äôs buildings. In 2013, she began to probe various questions that had arisen during her work on these projects. With the sculpture Interface No. 1, realized in 2012, she embarked on a multifaceted investigation of the form of the cube as such. A little later, she gathered initial ideas for a translation of Interface No. 1 into acoustic structures that the audience would experience in an installation with the title SonicCube (2014‚Äì). In the course of her examination of the form of the cube, Peters has devoted particular attention to its eleven nets, permutations that served as the point of departure for the sculptures Pandora‚Äôs Box (2016) and Untitled (Blaue Blume) (2017‚Äì18).Works such as Tango (2013‚Äì16) and Zabriskie Point (2013) have a basis in architecture, while also reflecting specific cultural or historic contexts. They are conceived as situations to which the viewer is encouraged to relate by contemplating or moving around them. Both works are composed of different elements whose arrangement in the space conveys an impression of a cohesive ensemble, addressing itself not just to the eye but also to the sense of touch and sensorimotor experience.The artist has had several solo exhibitions, including at Kunstmuseum Bonn (Zeichnung heute V, 2007); Kunstverein Ruhr, Essen (Modification‚Äîconstantly climbing stones, 2009); Kunsts√¶le, Berlin (Interplay, 2011); Galerie Aanant & Zoo, Berlin (Bilateral, Diagonal, Cubical, 2012); and the Arts Center Project Space at New York University Abu Dhabi (Pandora‚Äôs Box, 2016).Since 2007, Sandra Peters‚Äôs work has been shown in numerous group exhibitions in Germany and abroad, including at Tempor√§re Kunsthalle, Berlin (Zeigen. An Audio Tour through Berlin by Karin Sander, 2009); the MAK‚ÄìAustrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna (Envisioning Buildings. Reflecting Architecture in Contemporary Art Photography, 2011); Daimler Contemporary, Berlin (Conceptual Tendencies. 1960s to Today. Part II.

Maurice Pomerantz,Arts and Humanities,"Program Head, Arab Crossroads Studies; Associate Professor of Literature","BA, PhD University of Chicago",mp147@nyu.edu,Arabic literature,"Maurice Pomerantz is a scholar of Arabic literature of the pre-modern period. His interests include Arabic belles-lettres poetry and prose. His first book is entitled,¬†Licit Magic: The Life and Letters of al-·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib b.  øAbbƒÅd. Leiden: Brill, 2016. Licit Magic is the first study of letters of the tenth-century vizier and litt√©rateur al-·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib b.  øAbbƒÅd and their political, social and cultural dimensions. Exploring both the aesthetic and pragmatic sides of the vizier‚Äôs letters, the book portrays the vital role that literary eloquence played in early Muslim statecraft.Pomerantz‚Äôs current book project which he began as Mellon Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton in 2015-2016, expands his initial focus on Arabic literary culture. Entitled,¬†Rogue Fictions: the Lives of the Maqama, the book traces the history and circulation of the picaresque tales known as¬†maqaÃÑmaÃÑt. Invented in eastern Iran in the tenth century, these short Arabic stories describe a fictional trickster‚Äôs travels across cities of the Muslim world and beyond. Each tale follows a similar pattern in which a narrator recounts his entrance into a new city where he goes to a particular space (a market, a mosque, a hospital). There, he encounters an eloquent stranger in disguise who uses deceptive language and cunning to persuade others to offer the trickster money. The narrative reaches a climax when the narrator and/or audience recognize the individual as the notorious rogue and the two depart only to meet one another again in a different locale. The genre celebrates the boundless creativity of the author‚Äôs inventions, as each¬†maqaÃÑma¬†invites readers to use their own reason, knowledge, and experience to uncover the rogue‚Äôs latest plot.¬†Rogue Fictions¬†traces the circulation of maqaÃÑma by considering key moments in the history of the genre as it travels and transforms. Extending the methods of New Comparatist literary scholars such as Franco Moretti, Rogue Fictions charts the history of Arabic literature by situating formal changes to the maqaÃÑma within transformations in economy and society.Rogue Fictions¬†has grown out of more specialized work on the texts and manuscripts of¬†maqaÃÑma¬†collections. Since 2011, Pomerantz has been engaged in a joint project with Bilal Orfali (American University of Beirut) in editing and translating the foundational work of the genre: the¬†MaqaÃÑmaÃÑt¬†of BadiÃÑ ø al-ZamaÃÑn al-HamadhaÃÑniÃÑ (d. 398/1008). He also contributes numerous articles on a variety of topics to leading journals in the fields of Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies, such as¬†Arabica,¬†the Journal of the American Oriental Society, and the¬†Journal of Abbasid Studies.

Central to the project is a reductive theory of reasons for action, according to which reasons for action are considerations that figure into sound practical reasoning.Silverstein's other philosophical interests include normative ethics, the philosophy of action, political philosophy, early modern European philosophy, and the history of ethics.Before joining NYUAD, Silverstein was a postdoctoral fellow and visiting professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts.

His first book,¬†Doing Violence, Making Race: Lynching and White Racial Group Formation in the U.S. South, 1882-1930, develops an argument on how intergroup violence plays into boundary-making and identity-formation processes on the group as well as individual level. Applied to the lynching of African Americans by whites in the U.S. South, the book demonstrates how it fed off as well as into the generation of racial ideologies, boundaries, categories, and identities fomenting the emerging a system of durable oppression and inequality in the form of Jim Crow.His current book project,¬†Raging for Order and Domination: The Politics of Social Change and Lynching in the New South¬†(under contract with Columbia University Press), explores links between the lynching phenomenon and broad processes of social change previously unattended to by sociological research, including urbanization, industrialization, changing familial and gender relations, and state formation. An article deriving from this project, ‚ÄúRace, Gender, and Lynching in the U.S. South, 1881-1930‚Äù (forthcoming in¬†Social Problems), explores the contextual conditions wherein lynchings precipitated by alleged sexual assaults or transgressions by African American men against white females were more likely to occur. The results suggest that traditional ideals of white male racial and gender status and dominance were not merely served as a post hoc¬†exculpatory purposes used to cover up the ‚Äúreal‚Äù interests behind lynchings, but culturally and socially influenced lynchings in their own right. In so doing, lynching not only served to oppress African American men and women but to disempower white women as well.His research has appeared in¬†the American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Social Problems, Sociological Science, Ethnic and Racial Studies,¬†Social Science History, Organization,¬†American Journal of Economics and Sociology, and¬†Sociology Compass.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/mattias-smangs/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg
